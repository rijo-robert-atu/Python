## Description
The repository is about the Python programming language. The basic and advanced programming with python has been written and tested successfully. From the basic data types to object oriented programming. All the basics of python have been covered in this repository.

## Requirements
- Operating System :  Windows-10
- Python :   Version 3.9

## Tested Machine
Windows-11 with Python version 3.9.13

## Execution Method
Go to the Source/Exercise directory and run below command :

```python
python <Script>.py
```

## Git Branching

The branching strategy was used in the GitHub platform was to avoid unnecessary issues in the productinon branch. This will provide only stable codes to the production branch. The braches created below are to make the codes stable in the production.

- Main: contains only stable codes for the production.
- Test:  For testing and bugfixes in before pushing to production.
- Feature: Branch is used to add new features to the test and production.
- Bug Fix: Branch is used to fix the bugs in the stable code.

To the main branch the commits are done using pull requests. This will prevent accidental commits to the production stable codes. The pull request is associated with a code reviewer to check the codes and push it to the main branch.

## Bug Fix Request

Reported bugs can be found at [Bug Fix](https://github.com/rijo-robert-atu/Python/blob/989717801b3f12f3fd5def35ea06137751ba30ce/Documentation/Bug-fix.png)  

When developers encounter a bug with one of the Python programs, the below steps are used to solve the issue:
- A "Bug" issue is created for the identified bug as shown below.

- Clone the Python repo to local machine.


```
git clone https://github.com/rijo-robert-atu/Python.git
``` 

- bug-fix branch was created for the resolution.

- Then resolve the issue in the Gitbash terminal. here the student was using the Visual Studio Code to execute the git commands.
- The code is pushed to the test branch Once the issue is fixed. 
- After the tests conducted in the Test branch the code is pushed to main branch.

 
## Feature Request

Feature requests can be found at [Features](https://github.com/rijo-robert-atu/Python/blob/c1458a959f2c2a9eea0ea451f1203dcd97adae21/Documentation/Pull%20request%20for%20feature%20branch.png)

To create a new feature in the Python programs, developer has to follow below steps :

- A "update" issue is created as shown below.

- Clone the Python repo to the local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/rijo-robert-atu/Python.git
``` 

- A new branch is created from "Test" branch, named "Feature_#<issue number>" as shown below.  

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119352610/209512959-1c818968-b75a-4623-8da4-0d8ba7fb0074.png)
  
- Developer will work on the new feature. Then commits the changes to the feature_#1. Commit the changes to the Feature_#1.
- Now, checkout to "Test" branch and merge the newly created feature branch. Delete the feature branch.
- Once the tested are completed, Checkout to "main" branch and merge the changes made in "test" branch.
- Push the changes on local "Test" and "main" branches to remote repo.

## Authors

The Python repository was developed as a part of Infrastructure as a Code module. created by Rijo RObert.  

## Conclusion

All the scripts in this repository was tested. The basic and adavanced concepts of python programming has been pictured in this Repository. The person who will be learning the concept of python from this repository, should be able to develop the python scripts all by himself.
